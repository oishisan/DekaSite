DekaSite end user documentation
-------------------------------
This is a small and basic website for Dekaron private servers released 
exclusively on http://dkunderground.org .

Requirements
------------
Apache with .htaccess files enabled, PHP enabled, and PDO ODBC (windows) or PDO 
DBLIB (linux) extension enabled.

Installation
------------
1. Copy contents to your webserver's public folder.
2. Read and Edit config/config.ini

Adding extras features
----------------------
1. Create a database with the same name specified by extrasDB setting in 
config.ini. The specified user also needs to be able to have same privileges as 
the other dekaron tables require.
2. Uncomment (remove ;) from the update tables page in the white list.
3. Visit "update tables" page in browser and follow directions from there.
4. Remember, each time you update your DekaSite pages from the GitRepo, update 
your tables after.

Authorization and inheritance system
------------------------------------
If you have extras content enabled, you can create your own authorization 
"levels" for people who are logged in. This means that you can choose what 
group of people get to see what pages. The levels of "guest" and "member" are 
constant and cannot be changed. "Guest" pages are the pages everyone who 
isn't logged in can see, and "Member" pages are pages that everyone who is 
logged in can see.

---Authorization system---
Creating a new authorzation level is as simple as naming it. In the "whitelist" 
sections of the config.ini, just create a name with [] after it and set it 
equal to the pages it's allowed to view. Authorization levels only see their 
whitelisted pages + members unless inheritance is specified. By default in the 
config.ini, I have created two custom levels and divided the pages for GMs and 
Admins as I saw fit, however, feel free to change them.

Example: If I wanted to create a level for VIP only members to view experience 
banking, I would remove it from "members[]" and set it equal to something else 
like "vip[]".
---Inheritance system---
It's an optional system designed to save you typing. For each inherited 
"level", it is invoked in the "Other" section of the "config.ini" with the 
syntax "i.NAME[]" where "NAME" is the heir and set equal to the inheritance. 

Example: I want "Admin" to inherit "GM" pages so I make the setting called 
"i.Admin[] = GM". If i wanted to to inherit vip pages too, I just add a new 
line "i.Admin[] = vip".

Issues
------
If you have problems setting this up, feel free to post or PM me on 
http://dkunderground.org . My username is Oishi there. Also, if the problem is 
because your webserver does not meet the requirements, I will not help you 
because you can google the answer. However, I will let you know that's what the 
problem is.

All other bugs/glitches/etc can be reported here via GitHub's issue ticket
