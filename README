DekaSite end user documentation
-------------------------------
This is a small and basic website for Dekaron private servers released 
exclusively on http://dkunderground.org .

Requirements
------------
Apache with .htaccess files allowed, MSSQL exension enabled, and PHP enabled.

Installation
------------
1. Copy contents to your webserver's public folder.
2. Read and Edit config/config.ini

Adding extras features
----------------------
1. Create a database with the same name specified by extrasDB setting in 
config.ini. The specified user also needs to be able to have same privileges as 
the other dekaron tables require.
2. Uncomment (remove ;) from the update tables page in the white list.
3. Visit build tables page in browser and follow directions from there.
4. Remember, each time you update your DekaSite pages from the GitRepo, update your tables after.

Issues
------
If you have problems setting this up, feel free to post or PM me on 
http://dkunderground.org . My username is Oishi there. Also, if the problem is 
because your webserver does not meet the requirements, I will not help you 
because you can google the answer. However, I will let you know that's what the 
problem is.

All other bugs/glitches/etc can be reported here via GitHub's issue ticket 
system.
